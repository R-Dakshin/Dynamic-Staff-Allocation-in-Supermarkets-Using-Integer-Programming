        "Building upon insights from existing studies, this research introduces a Hybrid Rolling-Horizon Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model enhanced with Lagrangian-Assisted Decomposition and Greedy Repair mechanisms, designed for real-time and practical supermarket staff allocation.\n",
        "The proposed approach integrates several advanced concepts identified in prior works:\n",
        "•\tRolling-Horizon Optimization: Inspired by Li et al.’s real-time adaptive frameworks, the model continuously optimizes staffing over a short-term window (e.g., two hours divided into 15-minute intervals) and replans periodically as new demand data becomes available.\n",
        "•\tAsynchronous Multi-Skill Pooling: Extending the multi-skill resource allocation principles outlined by Kumar et al., employees can flexibly switch between roles—such as cashiering, restocking, or customer assistance—across different time slots, represented by binary decision variables.\n",
        "•\tFairness through Lexicographic Minimax Approximation: Drawing from Nguyen et al.’s fairness-oriented scheduling studies, the model minimizes the maximum deviation between actual and preferred working hours to ensure equitable workload distribution before addressing cost and coverage objectives.\n",
        "•\tLagrangian-Assisted Decomposition: To improve computational efficiency, coverage constraints are relaxed by departmental divisions, creating independent subproblems that can be solved in parallel. A subgradient-based update of multipliers and a greedy repair strategy subsequently restore global feasibility.\n",
        "•\tWarm-Start and Incremental Repair: Previous solutions are used as initial inputs for subsequent optimization windows, thereby reducing computational time and ensuring solution stability.\n",
        "•\tPractical Constraints Integration: The framework incorporates operational realities such as single-task-per-slot restrictions, minimum and maximum work-hour limits, rest-period requirements, and skill-task compatibility.\n",
        "Overall, this hybrid framework synthesizes real-time adaptability, multi-skill flexibility, and fairness-driven optimization, offering a comprehensive and implementable model for dynamic staff allocation in supermarket environments\n"
